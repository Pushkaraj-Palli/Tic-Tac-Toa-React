# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

## About the Project

This is a modern implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **React.js**. The game features an interactive UI where two players can take turns playing as "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The winner is determined based on traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players alternate turns as "X" and "O".
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects a winner or a draw.
- **Reset Game**: Easily reset the board to start a new game.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices.
- **Modern Styling**: Clean and minimalistic design.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Component-based UI framework.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
